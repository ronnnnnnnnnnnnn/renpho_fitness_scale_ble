"""Repair-issue scanning for renpho_fitness_scale_ble.

Surfaces drift between the integration's stored config and the
surrounding Home Assistant state on the Settings → Repairs page.
Issues are non-fixable from the Repairs UI itself — the fix is to open
the user's profile in the integration's options flow and correct the
field. Each issue's translated text tells the user what to do.

Issue types:

- ``person_entity_missing_<entry_id>_<user_id>``
    The user's profile points at a ``person.X`` entity that no longer
    exists. The location filter quietly drops users whose person state
    is missing or ``not_home``; once the entity is gone, the user is
    effectively excluded forever, which is rarely what was intended.

- ``person_entity_unknown_<entry_id>_<user_id>``
    The linked ``person.X`` exists but its state is ``unknown`` — the
    person was created in HA but no device trackers have been assigned
    to it. The location filter treats this as "not home", so the user
    is permanently excluded from auto-assignment. ``unavailable`` is
    deliberately *not* flagged because it's typically transient (HA
    restart, brief tracker outage); raising a flapping issue every
    reload would just be noise.

- ``mobile_service_missing_<entry_id>_<user_id>_<service_slug>``
    A configured ``notify.mobile_app_*`` service no longer exists.
    Sending an actionable notification to it would no-op silently —
    typical cause is the companion app being uninstalled or the phone
    renamed.

The scan runs at ``async_setup_entry`` and is re-scanned on options-flow
reload (which goes through ``async_setup_entry`` again, so no separate
update listener is needed).

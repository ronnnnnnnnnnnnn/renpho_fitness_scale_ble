"""Repair-issue scanning for renpho_fitness_scale_ble.

Surfaces drift between the integration's stored config and the
surrounding Home Assistant state on the Settings → Repairs page.

Note on the location filter: at runtime, the location filter only
*excludes* a candidate when their linked person entity is in state
exactly ``"not_home"``. Missing entities, ``unknown``, ``unavailable``,
and any other state are all kept as candidates (and there's a safety
net: if filtering empties the list, the unfiltered list is used). So
the broken-link issues below don't actively drop measurements — they
mean the location signal the user *configured* isn't doing anything,
and the integration falls back to weight-only matching for that user.

``mobile_service_missing`` and ``person_entity_missing`` are fixable
in-place — the right one-click action is unambiguous (drop the stale
entry / clear the broken link). ``person_entity_unknown`` is left
non-fixable because the right remediation usually isn't clearing the
link, it's assigning a tracker to the existing person; that's a
decision the user has to make.

Issue types:

- ``person_entity_missing_<entry_id>_<user_id>`` *(fixable)*
    The user's profile links to a ``person.X`` entity that no longer
    exists. The link is silently ignored at runtime (a missing entity
    doesn't exclude the user from auto-assignment), so the practical
    impact is just that the configured location signal is dead weight.
    The fix flow clears the link from the profile; relinking via
    Configure remains available for users who want to point at a new
    entity instead.

- ``person_entity_unknown_<entry_id>_<user_id>`` *(non-fixable)*
    The linked ``person.X`` exists but its state is ``unknown`` — the
    person was created in HA but no device trackers have been assigned
    to it. Same runtime impact as the missing case (not excluded, just
    no useful location signal). Surfaced as a warning so the user knows
    their configuration is degraded. Left non-fixable because the right
    remediation is usually "assign a tracker", not "clear the link".
    ``unavailable`` is deliberately *not* flagged because it's typically
    transient (HA restart, brief tracker outage); raising a flapping
    issue every reload would just be noise.

- ``mobile_service_missing_<entry_id>_<user_id>_<service_slug>`` *(fixable)*
    A configured ``notify.mobile_app_*`` service no longer exists.
    Sending an actionable notification to it would no-op silently —
    typical cause is the companion app being uninstalled or the phone
    renamed. The fix flow removes the stale entry from the profile and
    reloads the entry so the scan re-runs and the issue clears.

The scan runs at ``async_setup_entry`` and is re-scanned on options-flow
reload (which goes through ``async_setup_entry`` again, so no separate
update listener is needed).
